#Project Stage1
***
### What I have done
* constructor
* The general method of set, get, print
* Operator overloading of +, -, *

### The organization of my files
* **Two pairs of .cpp and .h file.The main.cpp shows the method of Class Matrix and Class Vector.**

### Notes
* Add a member function called 'create' to apply for memory. It can be **reuse** many time.
* Add a destructor to well manage the memory. 
* Change all the member function to const if they needn't to modify the member data.

**You can get my source code from [here](https://github.com/Z-Booker/Cpp_homework/tree/master/project)**
