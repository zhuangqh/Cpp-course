#Project Stage2
***
### What I have done
* Design a base class and let 'Matrix' and 'Vector' inherit from it
* Well managed constructor
* The general method of 'set', 'get' and 'print'
* The special method of 'any' and 'all'
* Operator overloading of +, -, *

### The organization of my files
* **Three pairs of .cpp and .h file.The main.cpp shows the method of Class Matrix and Class Vector.**

### Notes
* Add two member function called 'create' and 'clean'.Function 'create' is used to apply for memory. Function 'clean' is used to free memory.
* Add a destructor to well manage the memory. 
* Change all the member function to const if they needn't to modify the member data.
